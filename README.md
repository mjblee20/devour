# DEVOUR

In this app, the user will input the food they'd like to devour. When the user presses the submit button, the desired food will apper on the left side of the page with a button DEVOUR IT! When the user clicks it, the desired food will move to the right side of the page. When the desired food is on the right side of the page, the user can press the button BUY MORE! to send the item back to the left side of the page for further devouring. Every food will be stroed in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Focus

* Applying MVC design pattern
* Implementing MySQL, Node, Express, and a homemade ORM within the code to send information between the front-end and the back-end of the app.
* Using handlebars to generate dynamic html pages

## Future Development Ideas

* Increase the amount of information within the database
* Utilize JOIN method to link more information about a single item together
* Add more controllers and models for addition tables created in the database
* Improve aesthetics
